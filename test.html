		<p>I'm taking this class to improve my prospects once I have graduates with my Associate's this semester,
		even though it wasn't part of my original degree plan, because I know JavaScript is a versatile language 
		and the field is always looking for web developers.</p>
		<p>I used to study Biology at Texas State University, following the Pre-Med degree plan, for 3 years before I 
		realized that medicine was not the field for me - it was the dream of my family while my passion was always 
		with computers and technology.</p> 
		<p>In my free time I enjoy reading, playing videos games, and watching Premier League soccer. 
		My favorite book series is 'A Song of Ice and Fire' by GRRM, my favorite video game genre are RPG-based, 
		and my favorite team is Arsenal F.C..</p>
