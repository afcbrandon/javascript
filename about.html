        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Brandon Davila and I am 25 years old at the time of this writing. I enjoy reading, writing, and coding. I am a massive fan of the team Arsenal, from London, England, and am an avid nerd of various genres which consist of fantasy, sci-fi, and anime.</p>

        <h3>What I learned in this class</h3>
        <p>I learned on how to style webpages using Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), using JavaScript functions, and manipulating the DOM of an HTML file using JQuery. I have previous coding experience with languages such as C++ and Java, so the JavaScript function portion of this class wasn't difficult but it was interesting to learn about anonymous functions.</p>

        <h3>How this will help me in the future</h3>
        <p>I took this class for the benefits of delving into the world of Web Development, but the main reason being the ability to learn the basics of JavaScript. Learning the most used programming language was something I believed to help in not only my future endeavours to get a job, but also rounding off my skills at learning a new programming language in general. However, the most interesting technology that I learned was manipulating the DOM with JQuery. Though it may be "outdated" by modern programmer's, I believe it might give me a good foundational understanding in the case that I ever want to use Angular, React, or Svelte.</p>
